# Build-Web3 Product Catalog

This catalog is the maintenance source of truth for the Quicknode-specific portion of the
`build-web3` skill (everything under `references/quicknode/`). Marketing names and URLs
should match Quicknode's current public product pages.

## Future Sync Runbook

1. Compare Quicknode's current public product-page catalog with this file.
2. For each new or renamed page, copy the canonical product name and public URL.
3. Choose coverage:
   - `full` when an AI agent is likely to invoke the product directly.
   - `stub` when the agent should know the product exists but usually should not configure it directly.
   - `link-out` for staking, enterprise, or human-operated products.
   - `none` only with a note explaining why the product is intentionally excluded.
4. Update this catalog first, then propagate the change to `SKILL.md`, `references/quicknode-products.md`,
   the root `README.md`, and the relevant file under `references/quicknode/`.
5. Keep product-specific references in `references/quicknode/` separate from the provider-neutral
   files directly under `references/` — only Quicknode-specific product docs live in the subfolder.
6. Verify CLI and SDK examples against the current docs before release:
   - https://www.quicknode.com/docs/quicknode-cli
   - https://www.quicknode.com/docs/quicknode-sdk
7. Bump plugin versions in `plugins/build-web3/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
   `plugins/build-web3/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `plugins/build-web3/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`:
   - minor version for new products or substantial restructuring
   - patch version for renames, wording fixes, and stale-example cleanup
8. Run local checks for feedback markers, stale CLI examples, and invented Backfills paths. Avoid copying
   marker strings into docs outside this runbook.

```bash
rg -n "<feedback-marker-pattern>" .
rg -n "<stale-cli-or-backfills-pattern>" plugins/build-web3/skills/build-web3 plugins/build-web3/README.md README.md
```
